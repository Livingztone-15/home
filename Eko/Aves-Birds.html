  <h1>The Flying Vertebrates</h1>
  <h2>Defination of Aves</h2>
  <p>Aves is the bird class. It is a class that includes living species evolved from reptiles, not mammals. However, they have adapted to fly. Aves are warm-blooded species with scales on their feet.</p>
  <h3>Subclasses of Aves</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Archaeornithes</li>
    <li>Neornithes</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Aves Characteristics</h4>
  <p>What distinguishes Aves from other classes? What does Aves mean? Aves is a class including members with several special characteristics and modified body parts that distinguish them from other species such as:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Having feathers covering most of their bodies. The feather may either be a complete plumage or incomplete bristles. Feathers covering their spindle-shaped bodies help in reducing friction with air during flying and prevent the loss of heat. The complete fur covers all parts used while flying as well as other parts. While incomplete bristles consist of suspended plumule. The function of fur is to maintain body temperature, trick predators, help in flying, blend birds with their environment, attract other birds for breeding, and wrap the body.</li>
    <li>The two jaws of Aves lack teeth and they are modified into a beak. Characteristics of the beak of the bill differ from one species to another. For example, the size of the long beak is longer than the head of the bird. The short beak occurs when half of the bird’s size is shorter than its head. The shape of the beak differs too, as it can be associated when it is hooked because the longer upper part is curved over the bottom. A straight beak is when the beak line is straight. Other beaks include flat, toothed, and big marsupial beaks.</li>
    <li>Wings of Aves are modified from forelimbs. Wings differ among Aves species as they may be long, short, spherical, or pointy.</li>

  <h5>Aves Origin and Evolution</h5>
  <p>Aves are modern vertebrates. They represent a diverse recognizable group of birds. Evolutionary studies of birds’ fossils have transformed our understanding of the origin of birds and how they developed successfully over the past decades. Aves evolved about 160 million years ago during the Jurassic and they developed a light, small, winged, and feathered body which was evolved over millions of years gradually instead of being innovated in one burst. The diversity of Aves appeared during the Jurassic and Cretaceous. They were capable of flying with various growth rates. At the end of the Cretaceous, the mass extinction of birds was decimated along with dinosaurs. After the great extinction, new groups of birds appeared in more than 10000 species found all over the world.</p>
